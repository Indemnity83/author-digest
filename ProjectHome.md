This WordPress plugin allows authors to add a picture to their profile and helps automate the process of displaying author profiles for multi-user blogs

# Introduction #


# Features #

  * Automatic setup - no template/code modification needed
  * Widget to display profile in the side bar - fully configurable
  * Easy profile display with shortcodes - within a page or post simply add [printprofile](printprofile.md) to display your author profile and picture, or [printprofilepic](printprofilepic.md) to display your profile picture
  * Optional template override setting will make author links go to the author's profile
  * Work in tandem with Krischan Jodies' Get Recent Comments plugin (ie. displays your profile pic next to your comments)
  * For multi-author blogs, administrators can edit (read: moderate) other authors' pictures
  * For those old-school WordPress folks, the plugin supports a full set of template tags to enable template integration
